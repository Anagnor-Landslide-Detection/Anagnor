# Anagnor

Anagnor is a publicly available system to provide the users a predictive analysis of occurrence of landslides all across the world. It's a predictive model that maps and analyses land features, global precipitation patterns, uneven heating of land and tectonic activities to predict the occurrence of landslides around the globe. An easy-to-use integrated system allows anyone to seamlessly access data from the past, the present, and the future. Anagnor also allows authorities and civilians to take advance action, helping minimise the damage caused by landslides around the world. It also acts as a tool to spread awareness and leads a path to further modification and worldwide usage.

# Features and Algorithm

Unlike conventional landslide detection systems which mainly focus on rainfall and surface-water erosion, Anagnor focuses on several other factors that can also lead to major landslides like uneven heating of land, floods and earthquakes. The system can not only explain data to professional mitigation authorities but also to local people about such an imminent catastrophe.

Landslides are caused when land erodes due to its soil structure, water carrying capacity and external factors like rainfall, floods, uneven heating. Erosion causing landslides generally occurs from a higher to lower slope. Anagnor integrates the data from global precipitation and thermal soil mapping datasets to find the probabability of a landslide occurring.

The predictive model takes several other factors and analyzes it using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks. All four datasets are used in NetCDF format. NetCDF format is an array/matrix-like format, where the two dimensions are latitude and longitude. This is easily readable in Python and can be shown on the system that is comprehensive enough to the user.

Collaborating with locals, Anagnor also provides a cost effective underground device that needs to be installed in the underground water table to predict the tectonic activities in that area. ISince tectonic activities is another major cause for landslides, Anagnorâ€™s device helps the system get a more accurate prediction of the occurence of a landslide. However a technology that can predict tectonic activities in the present world has not really been developed, Anagnor brings a concept of achieving so by measuring and comparing concentrations of radon and its daughter products.

This is done by taking radon-dissolved underground water into a degassing chamber to extract radon that will be then transported to a Lucas scintillation chamber through a tesla valve. The tesla valve just ensures that there's no reduction in fluid pressure and velocity while going from degassing chamber to the scintillation cells. In the scintillation chamber, Alpha particles emitted, will collide with the surface made up of Zinc sulphide to generate light. Such light signals can be measured through a photomultiplier tube which transfers data about probable earthquake that might cause a landslide.

# User Interface

Anagnor has a very user-friendly user interface that helps user to easily access data. This helps to alert the locals and the authorities in a particular location to evacuate the landslide prone area and take necessary steps to mitigate/prevent landslides. Thus saving billions of dollars worth property and thousands of lives.

The only reason behind this project is to save lives and property that is damaged every year by landslides occurring all over the world. A predictive model like Anagnor helps the civilians know when a landslide might occur and thus evacuate the place in time / take steps to prevent such a grand calamity.

# Tools and Programming Language Used

GISTEMP 4.0, Python, React were used to develop the model and the system. The machine learning and data preprocessing models used Pandas, Numpy, Pytorch, Torchvision and NetCdf4 module. The hardware was designed on blender while all the UI design and motion graphics were made on Figma and Adobe After Effects.`
